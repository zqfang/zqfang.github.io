I would like to use Pandas to explore my data, but I did not find a convenient tool to do gene set enrichment analysis in python. So, here are my reasons:

* Ability to run inside python interactive console without having to switch to R!!!
* User friendly for both wet and dry lab users.
* Produce or reproduce publishable figures.
* Perform batch jobs easy.
* Easy to use in bash shell or your data analysis workflow, e.g. snakemake.

That's why GSEApy comes to play.
