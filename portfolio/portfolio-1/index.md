# GSEApy




I would like to use `pandas` to explore my data, but I did not find a convenient tool to do gene set enrichment analysis in python. 

I want something like this:

* Ability to run inside python console without switching to R.
* User friendly for both wet and dry lab users.
* Produce or reproduce publishable figures.
* Perform batch jobs easy.
* Command line support (Win, Mac, Linux).

That's why GSEApy comes to play. See code [here](https://github.com/zqfang/GSEApy)
