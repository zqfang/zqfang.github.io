# Snakeflow


My bioinformatic workflows using snakemake. I would update it if only I have more time.

Why snakemake?  

Good:
- Community
- Easy to use and update
- Reusable workflows
- Scalable
- Support conda env
- Support slurm, qsub ...
- python syntax

Drawback: 
- Hard to debug workflows. 


TODO:
* Integrate [snakemake-wrappers](https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake-wrappers) to current workflows to make it more reproducible.
