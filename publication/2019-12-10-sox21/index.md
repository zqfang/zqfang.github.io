# SOX21 Ensures Rostral Forebrain Identity by Suppression of WNT8B during Neural Regionalization of Human Embryonic Stem Cells


My PhD thesis. Published in *Stem Cell Reports*, 2019

Highlights
* The transcriptomic analysis of rostrocaudal patterning of hESC-derived NPCs
* SOX21 KO leads to caudalized regional identity in rostral forebrain progenitors
* SOX21 represses Wnt signaling to ensure the rostral forebrain identity
* WNT8B is a major downstream target of SOX21
