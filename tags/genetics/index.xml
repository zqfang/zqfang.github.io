However, one of my colleague who studies mouse genetics, said,
I tried the haplotype caller from GATK. But it seems that the haplotype caller is designed for heterogeneous genome like human than for mice. Therefore, the result coming out of HC is worse than samtools, as I manually inspected a few regions that HC calls didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense.</description></item></channel></rss>
